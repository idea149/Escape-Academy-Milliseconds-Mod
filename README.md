# MillisecondsTimer
Simple mod for Escape Academy that makes in-game timers display with millisecond precision

# Installation
## Pre-Reqs
### Un-Stripped DLLs
Modloaders do not seem to work well with Escape Academy due to some missing / stripped unity DLLs.

Download the [Required DLLs](https://unity.bepinex.dev/corlibs/2020.3.40.zip)

Browse to Escape Academy's installation directory
- Steam: Right click Escape Academy -> Manage -> Browse Local Files
- Epic: Right click Escape Academy -> Manage -> Installation -> File Browse icon

Navigate to `EscapeAcademy_Data/Managed` and extract the above DLL files here. You should be asked to replace files (say yes to this)

### Melon Loader
Install the MelonLoader mod loader using the MelonLoader.Installer.exe from the [github repo](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases)

When choosing a version in the launcher, choose **0.5.7**

Run Escape Academy. You should now see the Melon Loader splash screen while launching.

## Installing the mod

Download the mod from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/idea149/Escape-Academy-Milliseconds-Mod/releases) (MillisecondsTimer.dll)

Browse to Escape Academy's installation directory
- Steam: Right click Escape Academy -> Manage -> Browse Local Files
- Epic: Right click Escape Academy -> Manage -> Installation -> File Browse icon

Drop the `MillisecondsTimer.dll` file into the `Mods` folder
